# Generating images with dimensionality reduction

The goal of this project is to explore different dimensionality reduction techniques and their ability to generate images from the reduced data. To achieve this, we will use the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits.

The first step will be to apply PCA to the MNIST dataset and reduce its dimensionality. We will then generate images using the PCA components and explore how well the images capture the original data.

Next, we will use UMAP as an alternative dimensionality reduction technique and generate images from the UMAP components. We will compare the images generated from PCA and UMAP and analyze the differences in how well they capture the original data.

To assess the quality and compare the generated images, we will use visual inspection. We will also explore how the hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction algorithms affect the quality of the generated images.
